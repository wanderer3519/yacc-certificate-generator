If you don't know git.. don't panic.

Just do these after every work.
$ git add <file>
$ git commit -m <message>

If not yet convinced, use VS CODE's inbuilt git
Before doing `git push`, make sure to resolve all conflicts using `git pull` (also ask your teammates
if they have made any changes regularly).

Nevertheless, it is never too late to learn git. Please learn git during your course of work.
Thank you
